APPLICATION NAME: Tini_HairTies 

So here We start again!!!! 
Started creating a whole new web application last one had the following error ...

///No suitable constructor found for entity type 'TiniHairTiesContext'. 
The following constructors had parameters that could not be bound to properties 
of the entity type: cannot bind 'options' in 'TiniHairTiesContext(DbContextOptions<TiniHairTiesContext> options)'.///

Created a new README.txt file in the application

Added the 7 properties of my product to the file
